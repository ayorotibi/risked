The tool employs Dependency modelling, Bayesian concepts, Causal inferencing, Systems thinking, and GenAI to measure the degree of risk inherent in a system, based on the dependencies of it components.

It uses Streamlit's `pages` feature for easy navigation, and user is able to download reports of their analysis.
